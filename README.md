# Largest Squared Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

**Largest Squared Using Python** is a simple Python program that finds the **largest perfect square** from a given list of numbers or computes the **largest square value** based on defined logic in the script. The project focuses on strengthening problem-solving skills using Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, and mathematical operations.

This project is well-suited for beginners who want to practice Python programming and basic mathematical reasoning.

## 🧠 Problem Description

Given a list of integers (or a range of numbers), the objective is to:
- Identify numbers that are perfect squares, and
- Determine the **largest squared value** among them.

If no perfect square exists, the program can handle the case gracefully based on the implemented logic.
